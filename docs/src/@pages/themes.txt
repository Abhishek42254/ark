Themes
======

A theme is a collection of templates, styles, and scripts that together provide the look and feel for a site. Themes should be placed in the site's `lib` folder, and the name of the active theme directory specified in the `config.py` file.

    theme = "vanilla"

Ark ships with two builtin themes: `vanilla`, a simple default theme, and `debug`, a diagnostic tool useful when designing themes or debugging sites.

Note that you can override the currently active theme with the `build` command's `--theme` flag:

    $ ark build --theme debug

A theme directory should contain two subdirectories, `resources` and `templates`. The content of the `resources` directory is copied directly to the site's output directory during building. The `templates` directory contains the theme's template files written in the [Ibis](https://github.com/dmulholland/ibis) templating language.

When Ark generates an HTML page it searches for the appropriate template file in the following order, where `<type>` indicates the record type in question, e.g. `posts`:

*Record page*

    1) record-<type>.html
    2) record.html

*Directory index page*

    1) dir-index-<type>.html
    2) dir-index.html
    3) index.html

*Tag index page*

    1) tag-index-<type>.html
    2) tag-index.html
    3) index.html

A record can specify a custom template file to use in its header:

    ---
    template: my-custom-template
    ...

Note that the `.html` extension should be omitted from the filename.
